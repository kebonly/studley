# studley

This respository is a collection of all the practical tools I develop and want to use in the future.
The making of these tools is an iterative process. The making of these tools also serve the purpose
of learning the Rust programming language.

For context, "studley" refers to the legendary toolbox made by woodworker Studley. While his woodworks
were well made, the craftsmanship of the box which organized his tools was a work of art itself.
